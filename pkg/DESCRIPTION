Title: Extensible Markov Model (EMM) for Data Stream Clustering in R
Author: Michael Hahsler and Margaret H. Dunham
Maintainer: Michael Hahsler <michael@hahsler.net> 
Description: The Extensible Markov Model (EMM) adds a temporal component
	to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting
	Markov Chain. This package implements EMM on top of threshold NN, a 
	simple clustering algorithm for data streams. Development of this 
	package was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893.
