Title: R Implementation of the Extensible Markov Model (EMM)
Author: Michael Hahsler
Maintainer: Michael Hahsler <michael@hahsler.net> 
Description: The Extensible Markov Model (EMM) is a 
    time varying Markov Chain. It learns and adjusts its structure
    (number of states and transition probabilities) based on the input.
    It uses a very compact representation of dense regions in the data 
    (via distance based clustering) and therefore is suited for processing 
    data stream.
